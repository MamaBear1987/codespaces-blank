        <p> This is a webpage dedicated to <span>your's truly.</span> I am creating this page to show what I have learned so far in web Dev 1. While we are here I might as well tell you   a little about myself.</p>
        <p class="two"> I am a proud mom and soon-to-be wife. I have a very diverse taste in music and have been known to pick up a paint brush from time to time. I also really enjoy gardening and growing my own vegetables. My family is my life and<span> I love them more than the moon and the stars</span>. We love to go on nature hikes togeher when the time permits and fishing. </p>
        <p class="three"> I have come to school to learn all the skills I will need to hopefully one  day integrate my artistic flair into the digital world. I hope to one day be able to provide more for my family and give my sweet fiance a bit of a break. For my amazing son, I want to show him that its never too late to try something new, as long as you work hard for it.</p>
